Public opinion data helps us understand how individual characteristics and campaign messaging relate to voter preferences.  
Using data from a March 2024 YouGov survey of 1,559 U.S. adults, we estimate the proportion of votes Joe Biden is expected to receive in the upcoming presidential election.

Our estimates may be biased if late-deciding voters in November end up supporting Biden at different rates than those who expressed clear preferences in the March survey.
