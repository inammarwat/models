Public opinion data helps us understand how individual characteristics and campaign messaging relate to voter preferences.  
Using data from a March 2024 YouGov survey of 1,559 U.S. adults, we estimate the proportion of votes Joe Biden is expected to receive in the upcoming presidential election.

Our model suggests that around 42% of Americans intend to vote for Joe Biden, with a 95% confidence interval spanning roughly 39% to 45%.

However, these estimates may be off if voter preferences change over time or if the sample fails to reflect the final voting population. A more cautious estimate might range from 38% to 47% support for Biden.
